This is my first github-pages-jekyll post.

My name is Jujin Kim, live in South Korea.  

I'm studying computer science, game and something else awesome technology which makes us happy.  
I wanna learn computer science deeper. And wanna learn art such as game music composing, and illustration.
I'm currently working for company that manufactury mobile phone and develop an android application.

I'm also studying english now. So all of this blog's posts are written in english. Maybe some sentences in posts are not smooth or not correct. But I'm trying to be better. Please give me right expression if you find grammatically wrong sentence. Thanks for your understanding about this.
